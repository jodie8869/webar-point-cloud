# Project Tango Test
Most of the code is copied and modified from the Chromium WebAR examples https://github.com/googlevr/chromium-webar

* index.html - Run on tango device and sends point data to server
* server.js - Run on desktop, writes point data to disk as csv file (x;y;z)
* show.html - Loads and displays the saved point cloud file
